          <p> This system helps Ecom brands that have winning products to optimize their email marketing to get more engagement, sales and brand loyalty. </p>

          <p>  But before I get into how I accomplish this for you, I&apos;d like to mention why most Ecom brands struggle to get the conversions they&apos;re looking for.</p>

          <p>    If you&apos;re reading this page, you probably have a good product but you&apos;re still having some difficulty getting to the level of customer growth and most of all, retention that you&apos;re looking for.</p>

          <p> Getting and keeping clients is the number one thing stopping brands from scaling and achieving the next level of profitability.</p>

          <p>And after all, profit is to a business what blood is to the body.</p>
          <strong>
            Why your email list is the biggest asset to your business (after your product of course):



          </strong>



          <p> Not only is your email list sellable but it literally is proven interest in your brand.


            There&apos;s over 4 billion daily users on email and that&apos;s expected to grow to 4.5 billion by 2025!



            And over 50% of people buy from marketing emails at least once a month.

          </p>



          <p>
            Email is more commonly used than Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Amazon combined!

          </p>
          <p>
            Simply put, you&apos;re missing out BIG if you&apos;re not ALL IN on your email marketing.

          </p>
          <p>
            You&apos;ll want to have flows set in place for an email newsletter, welcome, abandoned cart and post-purchase, as well as occasional blasts.

          </p>
          <p>
            The thing is most brands know the importance of these flows but they aren&apos;t converting at the level they want.

          </p>
          <strong>
            How the “Strategic Conversion Method” transforms your email marketing into a money making machine.

          </strong>
          <p>
            The reason that most brands don&apos;t get high enough conversions from their email marketing comes down to three main things: Attention, Value and Trust.

          </p>
          <p>
            If you don&apos;t have all three of these pillars as a strong-point for your brand, you won&apos;t see the growth you&apos;re looking for.

          </p>
          <p>
            Let&apos;s break down what makes up these pillars:

          </p>
          <p>
            1)Grab ATTENTION through: open loop curiosity hooks, shocking statistics, FOMO, branding, powerful headlines.

          </p>
          <p>
            We live in a world where the ability to gain attention is one of the most valued skills.

          </p>
          <p>
            The single best way I&apos;ve found to grab people&apos;s attention is to make a bold claim or to bring them in with an open-loop curiosity hook (“[Firstname], does this gift sound too generous?” was one of my winning subject lines for a past client where the reader feels the need to close the loop by opening the email and find out what it is).

          </p>
          <p>
            It also never hurts to have eye-catching labeling and branding as well.

          </p>
          <p>
            These are sure-fire ways to get people&apos;s attention in a crowded marketplace.

          </p>
          <p>
            Now once you have their attention you need to…

          </p>
          <p>
            2)Build VALUE through: unique value proposition, educational product information, offer positioning and end result for your customer.

          </p>
          <p>
            At this point you&apos;ve probably made a big claim about a benefit and sucked them into the email.

          </p>
          <p>
            From here, it&apos;s about building the value so they actually feel the desire and need for your product.

          </p>
          <p>
            The way to do this is via your unique value proposition- the way to do this is to look at your competitors and ask yourself “How am I better than them?” and “What specific things make my product completely unique?”

          </p>
          <p>Then you need to have clear information that can be found about your product- the good news is since this can get lengthy it can be on your website product descriptions or “about” section rather than each individual email.</p>

          <p>     And the final result is to sell them the vacation- what is the end result they want.</p>

          <p>    Now that the reader sees your product as something that can improve their life it&apos;s time to…</p>

          <p>      3)Gain TRUST through: empathy and knowing their pain points, testimonials and risk reversals and guarantees.</p>

          <p>  From here, the only thing standing in between you and a sale is their level of trust.</p>

          <p> If they don&apos;t trust you, they won&apos;t buy from your emails.</p>

          <p>  The good news is you can build HUGE amounts of trust over time from your newsletters, adding value to them and of course proving it.</p>

          <p> You prove it via testimonials and showing other people&apos;s transformation.</p>

          <p>      Now that you&apos;ve grabbed their attention, shown value and built their trust, you&apos;ll get the sales you&apos;re looking for.</p>

          <strong>It&apos;s time to make selling easy.</strong>

          <p> Instead of following long, complicated frameworks, The “Strategic Outbound System” has been broken down into the three main categories necessary to make any sale.</p>

          <p>   This format can be used for welcome sequences, email newsletters, nurture sequences where you build value, abandoned carts and even cold email outreach!</p>

          <strong>What sort of results has this system delivered for businesses like yours?</strong>

          <p>  Since I&apos;m a results guy and don&apos;t take payment unless my work improves your business, I&apos;d like to show you a specific example of “The Strategic Conversion Method” in action.</p>

          <p>  TweedMaker is an Ecom brand selling quality, affordable tweed suits and clothing.</p>

          <p> While the techniques in my system will work for any brand, in any industry as they are universal, here&apos;s what was delivered for TweedMaker:</p>

            height={ 600 }
            priority
          />
